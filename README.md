Here is just a playground for Dataframe and Graph processings backed by GPU accelerated libraries from NVIDIA - RAPIDS [cuDF, cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/) in order to create such a comparison between regular desktop CPU-GPU architecture versus [Macbook m1](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746371/macbook-pro-m1-max-apple-gpu-performance-nvidia-amd)
